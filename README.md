# Hyper-V Autosnapshot Script for Windows

Automatic daily snapshot script solution

Hi, some time ago I was looking for a solution to this problem ... create a daily incremental snapshot powershell script (ps1).
Through a game of creation and renaming, backups always remain 5 ... of the previous 5 days (for example start the script every night).
